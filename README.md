## Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict housing prices in Bangalore.

## Project Concept and Inspriration:

Many times we have come across websites like "Magicbricks.com" or "99acres.com" where they sell and estimate the price of the property in many part of the country so this model is also inspired by the concept of predicting property prices based on the area, bedrooms, bathrooms and location.

## Steps involved
I first built the model using sklearn and machine learning algorithm using Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Then I programmed a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component was the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms, no.of bathrooms and it will  call the backend python flask server to give us the predicted price. During model building I came across all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, etc.
## Technologies used:

1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python Flask for Backend http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
